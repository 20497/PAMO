        Recipe for cheesecake\n

Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.\n

To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.\n

Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.\n

To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth.\n
To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps,\n
make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.
